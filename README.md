# Bulk-Coupon-Delete-Extension-for-Magento-2

The main agenda of the E-commerce stores to provide coupon codes is to plan the marketing frameworks and stimulate buyers in their store. Coupon codes are mostly provided to the customers in the product items or at the checkout for a fixed time period. The coupon codes are beneficial to both the customers and the store owner as the customers can get the product at a reduced price and the store owner can earn excess income. You can utilize coupon code benefits on either full or partial orders. The customer sanctions the coupon code at the checkout process, then all the conditions are matched and if they are satisfied then the customer can grab the product at an applied discount price by means of the cart price rules.
